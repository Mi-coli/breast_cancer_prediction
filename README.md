# breast_cancer_prediction
I needed a sample problem to explain to a non-technical audience for a job interview. I decided to go with a machine learning model intended to assist with classification of breast cancer.

Roughly 350,000 people get diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and once the diagnosis has been made, it is critical to quickly determine whether the lump is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The only way of determining this (at the time of this post) is for a biopsy to be performed, which consists of extracting a lump sample and evaluating the present cells for abnormalities. There are many factors that come into play when making a decision for whether or not the growth is cancerous or not, and time plays a huge factor in this decision because the sooner the treatment can take place, the higher the chances for survival.

This model uses the results from about 550 patients, all whom have gone through a FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration) biopsy, and uses the data from cells that were recovered from these samples to learn what features are associated with a benign versus malignant diagnosis. 

The goal of this research is to provide a more effective screening method that could assist clinicians in making a correct decision when it comes to cancer patient's treatment plans.
